            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">(Last Updated November 8, 2018)</p>

            <p>Alethia Ware LLC  and its affiliated or related companies (collectively, “Aletheia”, “we”, “us” or “our”), recognizes the importance of your privacy.  The purpose of this privacy policy (“Policy”) is to tell you what personal information we collect and how we use it.</p>

            <p>This Policy applies to the Space and Perspective applications, and all other applications, products or services which we offer today or in the future.  We may change this Policy from time to time, in our sole discretion, as discussed in section 7 below.  By registering an account or otherwise using any Aletheia application, software or service, or visiting any Aletheia website, application, product, software, tool, and/or service (collectively the "Services"), you are declaring that you understand and agree to the terms of this Policy.  Your privacy and control of your information is important; we hope that you will take the time to read this Policy carefully.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong>  We collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, for example when you access the Services, register an account, and provide personal information such as your e-mail address, user name or alias,  or other information.  Where applicable, personally identifiable information includes “personal data” as defined in applicable law.  We collect and use your personally-identifiable information to: make the Services available to you; allow you to access any personal account information you may have provided; provide customer service; communicate with you when requested; and  perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, Services and technology.  Note that Aletheia does not consider personally identifiable information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to identify you.</p>

                            <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CAPTURE PASSWORDS USED FOR ENCRYPTION OF YOUR DATA OR CAPTURE YOUR PRIVATE KEY.  THIS MEANS THAT WE CANNOT ACCESS THE DATA YOU UPLOAD.  IT ALSO MEANS THAT IF YOU LOSE ANY ENCRYPTION PASSWORD OR YOUR PRIVATE KEY <strong><u>YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE DATA YOU HAVE UPLOADED</u></strong>.  SO WE <strong><u>STRONGLY</u></strong> ADVISE YOU TO PRINT AND SAVE YOUR PASSWORDS AND PRIVATE KEY IN MULTIPLE SECURE LOCATIONS SUCH AS A BANK SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.</p>

                            <p>This Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including any other third party websites, services, applications, online resources to which the Services may link, access, or otherwise reference (collectively “Third Party Services” or “TPS”) through the Services.  We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any TPS you access.</p>

                            <p>You may always choose not to provide personally identifiable information, but if you so choose, certain parts of the Service may not be available to you (for example, you will only be able to access Services which do not require the payment of a fee).  If you have registered an account with us, you will have agreed to provide your personally identifiable information in order to access the Services.  This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to provide you access to some of the Services.  You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time; but keep in mind that any information contributed by you to a distributed ledger or blockchain cannot be altered or deleted by us or you at any time for any reason.  If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this Policy, please do not use our Services.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Sensitive Personal Data:</strong>  Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security number, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) to us.  The applications which are part of the Services allow you to upload any data you desire directly to the blockchain; unless you have encrypted your data such that a user requires a private key to gain full access, such data will be  freely and publicly accessible once mined to a blockchain.  Similarly, once such data is mined to a blockchain, is may not be removed or changed by you or by  us in any way.  Accordingly, we disclaim any obligation or ability to manage any data you upload to a blockchain, including sensitive personal data.</p>

                            <p>If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you create an account or communicate with us, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such content to us.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Non-Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong>  We may collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information which is information which does not permit you to be identified or identifiable either by itself or in combination with other information available to a third party.  This information may include a website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, hardware types, geographic location, and access times and durations. We also may collect navigational information, including the Service content you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Services.  We use this information to analyze usage patterns as part of making improvements to the Services.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p><strong>Third Party Payment Processing Service Providers:</strong>  The Services may utilize one or more third party vendors to process your payments for the Services.  We currently use Stripe (www.stripe.com).  Any personally identifiable information that you provide to process a payment for the Services is provided directly to such third parties and not to us, and will be used, stored and processed according their terms and policies.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong>. These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the Services (including the services provided by third party service providers) and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the sites or applications and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.

                                            <p><strong>Analytics and Performance Cookies:</strong>.

                                            <p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how the Services work.

                            <p>Aletheia will use the personally identifiable information directly provided by you solely for the purpose for which you have provided it, which may include:</p>

                            <ul>

You may opt-out of receiving such information at any time: such marketing emails tell you how to “opt-out.” Please note, even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your account with us (if you have one) and our business dealings with you;</li>
                                <li>to help our third party service providers to process payments you make via the Services; and</li>

                            <p>We may share this information with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as providing payments processing, data storage, data transmission, information requests, displaying stored data you access, to assist us in marketing, or other such services or support. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service they provide, will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and will be prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>

                            <p>We will only retain your personally identifiable information as long as reasonably required to provide you with the Services unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, for regulatory purposes).</p>

                            <p><strong>Disclosure:</strong>  As a general rule, Aletheia will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except under one of the following circumstances:  we have your express permission, including the permission granted in Section 2.a above by your acceptance of this Policy;  we determine in good faith that it is legally required to be revealed by any relevant statute, regulation, ordinance, rule, administrative or court order, decree, or subpoena; it is information that we determine must be disclosed to correct what we believe to be false or misleading information or to address activities that we believe to be manipulative, deceptive or otherwise a violation of law; where you are otherwise notified at the time we collect the data; where we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; when such disclosure is made subject to confidentiality restrictions in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by Aletheia.

                    <h2>Children's Policy</h2>

                    <p>The Aletheia Terms of Service clearly provide that Users must be (i) 18 or older, or (ii) 13 and older if either (a) an emancipated minor, or (b) he/she possess legal parental or guardian consent. Aletheia does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under 13.  In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a user under the age of 13, we will attempt to identify and delete that information from our owned and controlled databases or systems (expressly excluding a blockchain, which neither we nor you can alter or delete at any time for any reason).</p>

                    <h2>Security and Encryption</h2>

                    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information.  No method of transmission over the internet, mobile technology, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, while we endeavor to maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect online, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Our Services have security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption that encodes information for such transmissions. All Services information is maintained on secure servers. Access to stored data is protected by multi-layered security controls including firewalls, role-based access controls and passwords. You are responsible to keep your password secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at support@aletheiaware.com.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>

                    <p>We are a global business based in the United States.  Your data may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers. We may transfer data that we maintain about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected, including to the United States.  Those countries may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.  However, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your data remains protected to the standards described in this Policy.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your data.</p>

                    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, you are consenting to the transfer of your data to our servers in the United States.  We have implemented features and functions to provide an adequate level of data protection for the transfer of your data to the US.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

                    <p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Policy at any time. When we make changes, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of the Policy. If there are material changes to this statement or in how we will use your personal information, we will notify you by prominently posting a notice of such changes (i) via an alert within you applications, (ii) here or on our home page, or (iii) by sending you an email.

                    <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of your personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. California law provides that you have the right to submit a request to us at our designated address and receive the following information: (a) the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; and (b) the names and addresses of third parties that received such information, or if the nature of their business cannot be determined from the name, then examples of the products or services marketed.
