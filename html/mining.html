            <h1>Mining as a Service</h1>

            <p class="subtitle">Mining as a Service allows customers to contribute to the blockchain without using their CPU cycles and draining their battery.</p>

            <p>Mining is CPU intensive and uses a lot of energy.</p>

            <p>Mining on mobile devices drains battery and takes longer due to the CPUs running at a lower clock rate than desktop/server equivalent.</p>

            <p>Aletheia Ware provides Mining as a Service on per-byte metered rate of $0.01/MB up to 1GB maximum.</p>
