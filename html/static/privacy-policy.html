            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">(Last Updated November 28, 2020)</p>

            <p>Alethia Ware LLC and its affiliated or related companies (collectively, “Aletheia”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), recognizes the importance of your privacy.  The purpose of this privacy policy (“Policy”) is to tell you what personal information we collect and how we use it.</p>

            <p>This Policy applies to the Space and Perspective applications, and all other applications, products or services which we offer today or in the future.  We may change this Policy from time to time, in our sole discretion, as discussed in section 7 below.  By registering an account or otherwise using any Aletheia application, software or service, or visiting any Aletheia website, application, product, software, tool, and/or service (collectively the "Services"), you are declaring that you understand and agree to the terms of this Policy.  Your privacy and control of your information is important; we hope that you will take the time to read this Policy carefully.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong>  We collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, for example when you access the Services, register an account, and provide personal information such as your e-mail address, user name or alias,  or other information.  Where applicable, personally identifiable information includes “personal data”, “personal information” and/or “sensitive personal information” each as defined in applicable law.  We collect and use your personally-identifiable information to: make the Services available to you; allow you to access any personal account information you may have provided; provide customer service; communicate with you when requested; and  perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, Services and technology.  Note that Aletheia does not consider personally identifiable information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to identify a specific individual or household.</p>

                            <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CAPTURE PASSWORDS USED FOR ENCRYPTION OF YOUR DATA OR CAPTURE YOUR PRIVATE KEY.  THIS MEANS THAT WE CANNOT ACCESS THE DATA YOU UPLOAD.  IT ALSO MEANS THAT IF YOU LOSE ANY ENCRYPTION PASSWORD OR YOUR PRIVATE KEY <strong><u>YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE DATA YOU HAVE UPLOADED</u></strong>.  SO WE <strong><u>STRONGLY</u></strong> ADVISE YOU TO PRINT AND SAVE YOUR PASSWORDS AND PRIVATE KEY IN MULTIPLE SECURE LOCATIONS SUCH AS A BANK SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.</p>

                            <p>This Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including any other third party websites, services, applications, online resources to which the Services may link, access, or otherwise reference (collectively “Third Party Services” or “TPS”) through the Services.  We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any TPS you access.</p>

                            <p>You may always choose not to provide personally identifiable information, but if you so choose, certain parts of the Service may not be available to you (for example, you will only be able to access Services which do not require the payment of a fee).  If you have registered an account with us, you will have agreed to provide your personally identifiable information in order to access the Services.  This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to provide you access to some of the Services.  You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time; but keep in mind that any information contributed by you to a distributed ledger or blockchain cannot be altered or deleted by us or you at any time for any reason.  If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this Policy, please do not use our Services.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Sensitive Personal Data:</strong>  Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security number, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) to us.  The applications which are part of the Services allow you to upload any data you desire directly to the blockchain; unless you have encrypted your data such that a user requires a private key to gain full access, such data will be  freely and publicly accessible once mined to a blockchain.  Similarly, once such data is mined to a blockchain, is may not be removed or changed by you or by  us in any way.  Accordingly, we disclaim any obligation or ability to manage any data you upload to a blockchain, including sensitive personal data.</p>

                            <p>If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you create an account or communicate with us, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Policy.  If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such content to us.</p>

                            <p><strong>Non-Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong>  We may collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information which is information which does not permit you to be identified or identifiable either by itself or in combination with other information available to a third party.  This information may include a website that referred you to us, hardware types, geographic location, log data, and access times and durations.  We also may collect navigational information, including the Service content you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Services.  We use this information to analyze usage patterns as part of making improvements to the Services.</p>

                            <p><strong>Third Party Payment Processing Service Providers:</strong>  The Services may utilize one or more third party vendors to process your payments for the Services.  We currently use Stripe (www.stripe.com).  Any personally identifiable information that you provide to process a payment for the Services is provided directly to such third parties and not to us, and will be used, stored and processed according their terms and policies.</p>

                            <ul>

You may opt-out of receiving such information at any time: such marketing emails tell you how to “opt-out.” Please note, even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails.  Non-marketing emails include emails about your account with us (if you have one) and our business dealings with you;</li>
                                <li>to help our third party service providers to process payments you make via the Services; and</li>

                            <p>We may share this information with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as providing payments processing, data storage, data transmission, information requests, displaying stored data you access, to assist us in marketing, or other such services or support.  Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service they provide, will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and will be prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>

                            <p>We will only retain your personally identifiable information as long as reasonably required to provide you with the Services unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, for regulatory purposes).</p>
            
                            <p>You may contact us anytime to opt-out of: (i) direct marketing communications; (ii) our collection of sensitive personal data; (iii) any new processing of your personal data that we may carry out beyond the original purpose; or (iv) if applicable to you, the transfer of your personal data outside the European Economic Area (if it originates from the EEA).

We may share the non-personally identifiable information that we gather, in aggregate form only, with advertisers and other partners.</p>

In certain jurisdictions, you can request to have all your personal information deleted entirely.  Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:

                                    <li>
                                        <p>We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety.  For example, if we suspend an Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that Account to prevent that user from opening a new Account in the future.</p>

                    <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>

                    <p>California law permits California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties.

                    <h2>Security and Encryption</h2>

                    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information.  No method of transmission over the internet, mobile technology, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure.  Therefore, while we endeavor to maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect online, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  Our Services have security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  We use standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption that encodes information for such transmissions.  All Services information is maintained on secure servers.  Access to stored data is protected by multi-layered security controls including firewalls, role-based access controls and passwords.  You are responsible to keep your password secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at support@aletheiaware.com.</p>
