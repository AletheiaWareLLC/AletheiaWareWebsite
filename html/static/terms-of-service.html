                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Dispute Resolution Provision</h2>

                    <p>You and Aletheia agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the App or Service (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by individual binding arbitration; except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</p>

                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that you and Aletheia are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.  Further, unless both you and Aletheia otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.</p>

                            <p><strong>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</strong>  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section.  (The AAA Rules are available <a href="https://www.adr.org">here</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Arbitration Process.</strong> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration <a href="https://www.adr.org">here</a> and a separate form for California residents <a href="https://www.adr.org">here</a>.  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</strong>  Unless you and Aletheia otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Aletheia submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p><strong>Fees.</strong>  Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.  However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $20,000, Aletheia will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

                            <p><strong>No Class Action.  YOU AND ALETHEIA WARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

You may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@aletheiaware.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Aletheia’s email to you notifying you of such change.

                    <h2>General</h2>

                    <p>The failure of Aletheia to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.  The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Aletheia.  Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.  If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

                    <p>Certain Services features or application areas (and your access to or use of certain aspects of the App or Services) may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions.  If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the App or Service, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the App or Services.</p>
