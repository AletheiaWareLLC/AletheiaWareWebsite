            <p class="subtitle">(Last Updated November 28, 2018)</p>

            <p>This Beta Test Agreement (<strong>“Agreement”</strong>) is between Aletheia Ware LLC (<strong>“Aletheia”</strong>) and the individual identified below (<strong>“You”</strong> or <strong>“Your”</strong>) for you to accept <strong>Aletheia’s</strong> offer to join in the testing of <strong>Aletheia’s</strong> beta Perspective Service.</p>

This <strong>Agreement</strong> and the Terms governs <strong>Your</strong> access to and use of the Services and constitute binding legal agreements between <strong>You</strong> and <strong>Aletheia</strong>. In the event there is any conflict between the Terms and this <strong>Agreement</strong>, the provisions of this <strong>Agreement</strong> shall control.</p>

                    <p>The Services are a beta release offering and are not at the level of performance of a commercially available product offering.

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN ADVICE OR CONSULTATION GIVEN BY <strong>ALETHEIA</strong>, ITS AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY WAY GIVE RISE TO A WARRANTY.

This <strong>Agreement</strong> shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. <strong>You</strong> agree that breach of this <strong>Agreement</strong> will cause <strong>Aletheia</strong> irreparable damage for which recovery of damages would be inadequate, and that the <strong>Aletheia</strong> shall therefore be entitled to obtain timely injunctive relief under this <strong>Agreement</strong>, as well as such further relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.  <strong>You</strong> will not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this <strong>Agreement</strong> without the prior written consent of the <strong>Aletheia</strong>.</p>
