            <h1>Need Space?</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Space is an end-to-end encrypted, blockchain-based cloud storage platform.</p>
            <p>How much data do you have stored across multiple devices?</p>
            <p>TODO introduction</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> - Aletheia Ware does not store your password or private key and therefore, unlike other cloud storage providers, cannot read your data. Instead, Space encrypts data on your device before upload using your public key. Upon download, Space decrypts your data on your device using your private key.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity</strong> - a cryptographic signature ensures your data is not modified while uploading to Aletheia Ware's servers, and once mined into a blockchain a cryptographic hash along with your signature ensures your data is indelible and immutable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Download & Install</h2>
            <p>Space is available for the following platforms;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Android - $1 - <a href="https://play.google.com">Google Play Store</a></li>
                <li>iOS - Coming soon - early 2020</li>
                <li>Linux - Coming soon - late 2018</li>
                <li>MacOS - Coming soon - late 2018</li>
                <li>Windows - Coming soon - late 2018</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Register & Subscribe</h2>
            <p>When you create an Aletheia Ware account with a unique alias and a password of at least 12 characters, a 2048bit RSA public/private key pair is generated. Your alias and public key are registered with Aletheia Ware servers, and your private key is encrypted with your password and stored on your device - it does not leave your possession and therefore only you can decrypt your data.</p>

            <p>To prevent loss of access to your data in case your device gets damaged, lost, or stolen, Aletheia Ware reccomends making a hard copy of your key pair and storing it in a secure location such as a fire-proof safe, or bank vault.</p>

            <p>Aletheia Ware offers 3 subscription tiers to choose from; Basic (default), Standard, and Premium</p>
            <table class="tier-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Basic</th>
                    <th>Standard</th>
                    <th>Premium</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Free</td>
                    <td>$10/mo<br />or<br />$100/yr</td>
                    <td>$100/mo<br />or<br />$1000/yr</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5 MiB/mo</td>
                    <td>50 MiB/mo</td>
                    <td>1 GiB/mo</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1 GiB max</td>
                    <td>30 GiB max</td>
                    <td>1 TiB max</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Standard and Premium subscriptions can be paid monthly or yearly, the later being the most cost effective - 12 months for the price of 10.</p>
            <p>Each tier has a limit of how much data can be mined each month, and a maximum data storage quota. Data size is measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix">binary prefix</a>.</p>

            <h2>Encrypt & Upload</h2>
            <p>Once a file have been selected for upload a 128bit AES key will be generated and used to encrypt the file. The key itself is then encrypted with your public key, and uploaded, along with the encrypted file, to Aletheia Ware servers to be mined into a blockchain.</p>

            <h2>Download & Decrypt</h2>
            <p>After being mined, your encrypted data and associated key can be downloaded, decrypted using your private key.</p>

            <h2>Export & Import</h2>
            <p>Your public/private key pair can be exported to other devices giving you easy access to your data from any supported device. Provisioning your key pair on multiple devices can also help prevent loss of access to your data in case one of your devices gets damaged, lost, or stolen.</p>
